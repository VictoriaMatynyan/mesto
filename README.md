# Project No.3: [Mesto](https://victoriamatynyan.github.io/mesto/)

## Review

Thisp project is realized during studying at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) for web-developers.
Mesto (or 'Place' in English) is performed as an interactive web page for posting pictures and gaining likes.
For 3 Sprints at Yandex Praktikum this project was being updated in its features. Now it is being updated in its code performance, using more JavaScript language.

## Applied decisions in Project No.3:

* HTML and CSS coding;
* JavaScript for popup realizing and for profile info manipulations;
* Form validation performance via JavaScript;
* JavaScript classes and modules;
* Object-oriented programming (OOP);
* BEM methodology in file structure (nested);
* CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* CSS transition;
* media queries for desctop and mobile versions (from 1280px to 320px).
